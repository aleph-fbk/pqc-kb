## Introduction

In current times, the transition to "post-quantum" seems unavoidable. But why so? "Quantum computers are powerful", people always say. While this may be true, the feeling about this quantum kingdom-come in the common audience is just... not that grievous. But, how can you blame someone for not being scared of something so distant and ethereal? As a matter of fact, the narrative about quantum computers has often the flavour of a scary story to tell kids that misbehave. Our aim is to describe the threat that quantum computers represent from a high level perspective, with a practical approach and without mistifying the topic. We're not here to scare, but inform. Whether you'll be scared or not in the end, is up to you.
