## Introduction

In current times, the transition to "post-quantum" cryptography is being discussed as unavoidable. But why so? The common trend in asking to this question briefly is "quantum computers are powerful". While this may be true, the feeling about this quantum kingdom-come in the common audience is just... not that grievous. But, how can you blame someone for not being scared of something that they perceive as distant and almost ethereal? As a matter of fact, the narrative about quantum computers has often the flavour of a scary story to tell kids that misbehave. Our aim is to describe the threat that quantum computers represent from a high level perspective, with a practical approach and without mistifying the topic. We're not here to scare, but inform. Whether you'll be scared or not in the end, is up to you.

## Why do we need POST-Quantum?
Let's describe what makes a quantum computer a (supposed) threat. Before, intellectual honesty imposes a remark:

> [!REMARK]
> Quantum computers are still moving the first steps and are a THEORETICAL threat. No [quantum computer](https://www.spinquanta.com/news-detail/discover-the-worlds-largest-quantum-computer-in20250106092507) at the moment is powerful enough to make [economies fall](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.15907v1). Or to factor the number 42, for what it matters (and it does not, as 42 has 3 factors).

But there's a reason to have concern and to start taking precautions now. We don't really know WHEN (or even IF, to be honest) quantum computers will become a practical threat, but we know what will happen if stars align and the quantum threat becomes real before we took shelter. Let's make a mental game: Bohb comes from the future with his time machine. In his timeline, quantum computers replaced classical ones, to the point that every kid uses his DOLL-Atom3000 to check the weather on Mars for the weekend. Bohb is making a thesis on anthropology (a futur-ish version of it) and wants to check what would happen if quantum computers were dropped in a society not ready for them. We are his test subjects. Let's see what Bohb would put in his report.

Old communications containing sensitive or secret data are now being decrypted. Many military and intelligence secrets are being leaked to the public. Now even governments aren't to be trusted ($\textit{Editor's note: assuming you trusted them before}$)
