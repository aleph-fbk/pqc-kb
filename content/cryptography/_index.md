> [!caution] Problem
> [Shor's algorithm](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.quant-ph/9508027)[^S97] allows a sufficiently powerful quantum computer to recover private keys from public keys for legacy cryptosystems, in particular by [factoring RSA public moduli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10044)[^E07] and [breaking the (EC)DLP](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/598)[^RNSL17].
>
> This drives the need to replace all public key algorithms, particularly digital signatures and key exchange / encapsulation.

> [!important] Solution
> Post-quantum cryptography is about finding new problems that are presumed to be difficult to solve on both classical and quantum computers -- until proven otherwise -- and building new cryptosystems on these problems.
