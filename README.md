A short primer for a mixed audience, including cryptographers, IT professionals, compliance officers, and students.

This resource aims to be precise but concise, with enough material to get readers started but plenty of references to keep going.

Topics include:
- the mathematics of cryptography, old and new;
- standards and official cybersecurity guidelines and recommendations;
- the transition process, including pointers to useful tools for cryptographic inventory, agility, and compliance;
- quantum information, to facilitate an understanding of what motivates the process.

> [!warning] Work in progress.
> This resource should be considered an alpha release, i.e., not yet feature complete.
